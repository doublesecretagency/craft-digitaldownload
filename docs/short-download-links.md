# Short Download Links

A complete action URL in Craft can be long and ugly...

```twig
https://example.com/index.php/actions/digital-download/download?u=(token)
```

So we've made it easy for you to generate short download links, which can be customized...

<img :src="$withBase('/images/short-download-links.png')" class="dropshadow" alt="">

By default, the value of this field will be set to `download`.

If you want to customize the URL further, simply visit to the plugin's **Settings** page.
